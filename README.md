# Building Accurate and Interpretable Online Classifiers on Edge Devices

This repository contains our implementation of Onfesk, which builds accurate and interpretable online classifiers on edge devices, while providing model interpretability. 
Specifically, Onfesk_code.cpp is a version that can be compiled independently.
The rest are the codes used in all experiments. 
The codes must be built with the Intel(R) oneMKL library, which can be obtained through:

```

Both of our SetXor and SetXorDyn construct a compact bit matrix and performs bitwise XOR operations when adding elements or merging sketches. Additionally, they incorporate a random response mechanism to satisfy Differential Privacy (DP) and estimates the intersection cardinality through the estimation of the difference set cardinality. Moreover, we conducted extensive experiments to compare the performance of our SetXor with the method [SFM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02056.pdf) and the state-of-the-art method [LL](https://research.google/pubs/pub49177/). 

### Datasets
Our experiments encompass five real-world datasets, including four non-image datasets (Webspam, URL, RCV1, Real-Sim) and one image dataset (MNIST). 
To suit the online setting, we select around 15, 000 examples with the largest length from each datasets and randomly shuffle them.
The Webspam dataset consists of web pages that were automatically collected from the Internet, which can be accessed through the following source: 
```url
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#webspam
```
The URL dataset comprises both lexical and host-based features
associated with malicious and benign URLs, which can be referred through: 
```url
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#url
```
The RCV1 dataset is a document-word collection derived from the Reuters Corpus, Volume 1, which can be obtained through:
```url
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#rcv1.binary
```
The Real-Sim dataset consists of articles from various discussion groups (labeled ), which can be obtained through:
```url
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#real-sim
```
The MNIST dataset contains 28 Ã— 28 pixel images of handwritten digits, which can be referred through: 
```url
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html#mnist
```
